# üì° Home Wi-Fi Network Monitor Dashboard (Splunk)

This project simulates a Security Operations Center (SOC)-style monitoring dashboard to analyze Wi-Fi traffic using Splunk.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

Track and visualize:
- Devices connected to your Wi-Fi network
- Which websites/IPs they connect to
- Network traffic volume and trends

All done **offline**, using `.pcap` and `.csv` log files via Wireshark.
